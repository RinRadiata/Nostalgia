Rin "Another night.{wa} Another book.{wa} Another silence."
Rin "They said witches find truth in isolation,{wa} but all I’ve found... is absence."
Rin "That dream again. Always the same.{wa} A sea of red flowers…{wa} then white, like ash in wind."
Rin "What am I forgetting?{wc}Or perhaps, what am I meant to never recall?"

narrator "Rin closes her book, fingers tracing the golden-etched cover. Her symbol glows faintly. She clenches her hand."

Rin "It’s glowing again. Stronger this time…"

Rin "I cannot rest. The dreams—"

Rose "Yes. I felt it in the air. The lycoris stirs."

Rose.SetSprite(gentle)
Rose "Your bloom deepens. The Garden is whispering to you."

Rin "The Garden… you’ve mentioned it before. Why does it feel familiar?"

Rose "Because it is. But familiarity does not always mean safety, child."

    -Ask about the Garden
        Rin "What is the Garden, truly? Why do I feel it calling?"
        Rose "It is the truth behind the veil, the origin of your kind… and the end of many."
        Rin "My symbol reacts to it."
        Rose "Because part of you already touched it. But you left something behind."
    -Ask about the Memory
        Rin "That girl… her name was El."
        Rose "A bond forged before you became who you are now."
        Rin "Is she alive?"
        Rose "Perhaps. Or perhaps she waits in the place where all memories are weighed."
        Rin "The Garden?"
        Rose "If you go there, child, be ready to pay in remembrance."

narrator "Rin stands alone, gazing out the tall window. The forest stretches beneath, silver under moonlight. Her cloak flutters gently."

Rin (monologue) "I don’t know what waits beyond the trees. But if I stay… I’ll fade."

Rin "El… I’ll find you. Even if I must lose myself again."
