EDEN: A Flowering Wave of Nostalgia

====================================

Chapter 1 — The Flower That Blooms on the Other Shore

(“Higanbana – The River That Souls Cannot Cross”)

[Opening Scene: Night. Silver moonlight shimmers over a still river — the endless flow of the River of Oblivion.]

Narrator (Andersen’s voice):
Beyond the veil of life and death lies a river called Vong Xuyen,
the River of Forgetfulness.
Its waters are still, yet each ripple carries thousands of memories —
dreams, promises, and tears long forgotten.

Along its banks bloom the otherworldly flowers —
the Higanbana, the Flowers of the Other Shore.

It is said that every petal holds a memory left behind
by a soul before stepping into the cycle of rebirth.
Red, white, or yellow —
each color tells a story of love, sorrow, and parting.

[Effect: A red petal falls onto the surface of the river.
A pale girl in white stands by the water, her eyes devoid of earthly light.]

???:
You still stand there, staring across the river...
This path is not meant for those who cling to memories.
Once you cross the Bridge of Reincarnation,
you will forget everything — even your own name.

Soul (Player):
…I don’t want to forget.
There’s something… on the other side that I must find.
A face… a smile… or perhaps a memory long faded?

???:
Then you have chosen the path of pain.
Those who hold onto their memories
are forever trapped between two shores —
unable to move forward, unable to return.
That is the curse of
“Higanbana – The River That Souls Cannot Cross.”

[Scene shift: The sky turns crimson.
Higanbana flowers bloom in full, covering both banks.
In the wind, countless whispers of lost souls can be heard.]

Narrator:
Long ago, there were two lovers — Manju and Saka.
One planted the flower, yet could never see it bloom.
The other watched it bloom,
yet never knew who planted it.

Bound by heaven’s decree,
they were never meant to meet.
So they became the Higanbana —
one side the red flame of longing,
the other the white silence of oblivion.

Every soul that passes this river leaves behind a color of its own:

Red, for pain unending.

White, for release and purity.

Yellow, for eternal separation.

[Effect: Thick mist.
A faint image of a long-haired girl — Rin — appears in the soul’s mind.]

Soul:
Rin… That’s her name.
Why… why do I still remember her?

The unseen voice:
Because once, you made a promise —
“When the Higanbana blooms, we will meet again.”

[Bright light envelops the screen. Fade out. Title appears.]
